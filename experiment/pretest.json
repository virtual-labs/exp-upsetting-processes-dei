      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreasing diameter and increasing height",
        "b": "Increasing diameter and increasing height",
        "c": "Increasing diameter and decreasing height",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
       "explanations": {
    "a": "Incorrect. Upsetting increases diameter, not decreases it.",
    "b": "Incorrect. Upsetting does not increase height; it reduces height.",
    "c": "Correct. Upsetting is a metal forming operation where the billet height decreases and diameter increases.",
    "d": "Incorrect. One of the options describes upsetting correctly."

    "d": "Lead"
  },
  "explanations": {
    "a": "Incorrect. Titanium is one of the materials used in upsetting simulations.",
    "b": "Incorrect. Aluminium is commonly used in metal forming simulations.",
    "c": "Incorrect. Copper is also used for upsetting operation demonstrations.",

  "answers": {
    "a": "Open die forging process",
    "b": "Close die forging process",
    "c": "Both",
    "d": "None"
  },
  "explanations": {
    "a": "Correct. Upsetting is typically performed as an open die forging operation applied to increase diameter by reducing height.",
    "b": "Incorrect. Close die forging involves impression dies, not simple upsetting.",
    "c": "Incorrect. Upsetting mainly refers to open die forging, not both types.",
    "d": "Incorrect. Upsetting is indeed a forging process — specifically open die."
