      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — In the upsetting process module, four different presses are demonstrated, each representing different force application conditions.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Only one press is not shown; multiple presses are demonstrated.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Three presses are less than the actual number shown.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Seven presses are not shown in the module."

      "question": "Q2. The L/D ratio used in interactive bench of simulation for upsetting process are:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1.0,2.0,3.0",

        "d": "10.0,12.0,15.0"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — These values are possible but not the ones used in the bench simulation.",
        "b": "Correct — The simulation commonly uses billet aspect ratios of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 to study deformation patterns.",
        "c": "Incorrect — These are too large for typical upsetting simulation.",
        "d": "Incorrect — These ratios are used for tall cylindrical workpieces, not for upsetting simulation."

        "d": "1 mm/sec & 10 mm/sec"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — These speeds are too low to represent complete deformation range.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Partially correct speeds but not the full range used.",
        "c": "Incorrect — These represent only higher strain rate conditions.",
        "d": "Correct — The simulation tests the effect of slow (1 mm/sec) & high (10 mm/sec) die speed on deformation."

        "b": "Upper die",
        "c": "Both",
        "d": "None"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — The lower die is usually fixed in place.",
        "b": "Correct — In most forging and upsetting operations, the upper die moves downward to apply compression.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Both dies do not typically move in standard setups.",
        "d": "Incorrect — At least one die must move in upsetting."

      "question": "Q5. Which process involves increasing of the cross-sectional area by pressing or hammering in a direction parallel to the original ingot axis:",

        "b": "Swaging",
        "c": "Upsetting",
        "d": "Setting Down"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Peening improves surface finish and relieves stress, not used for cross-section increase.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Swaging reduces diameter using repeated blows.",
        "c": "Correct — Upsetting increases the diameter by shortening the height through axial compression.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Setting down is used for local reduction in thickness of a bar."
