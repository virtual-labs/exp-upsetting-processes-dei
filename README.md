### About the Experiment 

Upsetting is defined as 'free forming', by which a billet or a portion of a workpiece is reduced in height between usually plane, parallel plates [ASM Handbook 1988]. Upsetting is a basic deformation process which can be varied in many ways. Upsetting of metals is a deformation process in which a (usually round) billet is compressed between two dies in a press or a hammer. This operation reduces the height of a part while increasing its diameter.
